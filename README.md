### Title: NBA: Who is the G.O.A.T?

Page Description:
  A never-ending argument amongst NBA fans has always been, "Who is the GOAT?", meaning greatest of all time. Many say it's Michael Jordan, many say Lebron James, some say Kobe Bryant, and some also say Steph Curry. To be honest, the conversation/argument will never get settled. This website will only compare the Top 3 competitors for the title. It will compare their achievements, overall impact on basketball, players' opinions, etc. It's still up to YOU to decide who is the greatest. We all have different opinions and the site is only here to provide info and compare. No bias whatsover will be given in making the website.
