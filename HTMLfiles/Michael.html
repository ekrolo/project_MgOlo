    <p> There's no doubt that Michael Jeffrey Jordan will be in this debate. The first ever to be in the GOAT talks, he has had a very loud and iconic NBA career. Winning 6 Championships with the Chicago Bulls, he has a 6-0 (W-L) record in the NBA Finals. He's also know to push his teammates out of their boundaries and push them to be better. His most popular winning season was the 1996 season where the Chicago Bulls managed to obtain a 72-10 win-loss record, and win the championship. One of Jordan's most iconic moments was the flu game (played even when he was ill), where he scored an unbelievable 38 points, as well as 7 rebound ands 5 assists. The game-winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals is also one of his magical moments. With 6.6 seconds left in the clock, Jordan stepped back and drained the 2-pointer which led the Bulls to their 6th Championship against the Utah Jazz. </p>
